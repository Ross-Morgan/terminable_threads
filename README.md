# Terminable-Threads

A library providing a Terminable Thread Manager called `TerminableThreads<T, N>`

All functions used in threads that this manages use a flag to signal termination

## Note

This was designed more for learning that practicality, but I needed 
this functionality in another project that I was working on at the time
